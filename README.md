# Horoscope_Generator
For IS 3020 Project - A daily horoscope generator. I intend to include a web scrape that will take daily horoscopes from different astrology websites to produce an update horoscope whenever the user wants. 

# How to use
You will enter your zodiac sign and the program will allow you select a horoscope for yesterday, today, or tomorrow.
