# Horoscope_Generator
For IS 3020 Project - A daily horoscope generator. I intend to include a web scrape that will take daily horoscopes from different astrology websites to produce an update horoscope whenever the user wants. 

# How to use
You will enter your zodiac sign. If you do not know this, you may enter "don't know" and the program will provide a list of all the zodiac signs and their respective birth dates associated. 

# Resources
I will be using the following resources to assist with the project.
